So even as I type this, this is not my first blog post.  I have been playing with the concept of a blog for some time.
I had gotten the idea from [NetworkChuck](https://youtu.be/gwUz3E9AW0w).  I really liked the points he had made regarding
why you should have a web site.  After watching that video I started playing with the idea of a blog.  So I took a Raspberry 
3b and spun up a LAMP Server with Wordpress.  I made some posts on it and used it as kind of a diary to track some progress
on studying and projects I was working on.  Over the summer I fleshed out what I wanted from the blog, basically to showcase
my skills and to teach others.  

I never really pulled the trigger on it.  Partly because I didn't really want to support a whole Wordpress site.  I had 
flirted with spining it up on Microsoft Azure, Linode, or Hostinger but knew it would be a $5 per month cost.  The cost
didn't bother me but it was a little excessive and I can use that $5 for other things.  

Last weekend I came up with a crazy idea.  I had started honing my skills with first emacs, then Org, then utimatly settiling
on Markdown.  I figured I could use Markdown in Github to make blogposts and somehow feed it back to a domain I had 
purchased for testing (redlantern.tech).  Going though Github's documentation, I found you can host a whole site
using Markdown, Jekyll and Github Pages.  For the last few days I have been playing with coding up a site.
I had gone though numberuse trial end errors and I have to say, it was a learning experience.  

My research and study eventulaly led me to Barry Clark's [Excelent GitHub Project and Tutorial](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
From there I was able to not only get things up quckly but I was able to understand it.  

So my plan will be to pick and chose what was on my old Wordpress site and bring over.  But going forward, we will
see where this leads. 

Thank you and Take Care
