If someone was to ask me, "Hey, I'm a young guys who wants to get into the IT field, whats a good job to have when you are starting out?"  Most people would
assume I would say something like fixing computers on the side, or get into a small computer shop (if those exists anymore) or even see if you can intern as a 
computer tech.  Honestly, as I look back, I think these jobs are great but lack something that is the most important aspect of the IT field that I wish
someone had told me before I started my career path back when I was a teenager.

The IT Field is a Customer Service Job.

Let me start at the beginning.  Most young individuals (myself at one point), always thought of IT as being in the back, working on servers and computers, solving problems, developing new software, sitting in a dark room, just working on computers all day.  Don't get me wrong, there are days like that
But most days, you will be working with customers (yes, I'm including co-workers if you are in corporate IT).  You will be working with people that may know little or nothing.  Its not like the IT Crowd where you are in a basement 24/7, but out in the public or office environment working with people that may act not better than someone at a a fast food restaurant.  And you are going to need to know how to deal with people. 

I have read stories about IT guys that are just mean, or not very friendly.  They do not want to interact with people.  Sure they are probably walking legends 
who can make me with my 14+ years of experience look like a teenager in my parents basement.  But if they lack the social skills or the emotional intelligence to deal
with customers (or coworkers), then they are not very good as they can't do the job without making someone uncomfortable, or worse, want to use your services.

I have a different aspect then most people,  I have been in a MSP (Managed Service Provider) for 14 years.  So customer service is defiantly number one for me.  I want customers to come 
to me with issues, I want them to feel like they are getting what they paid for.  They want to feel like I understand their problem.  Also I have to be able to explain
it in a way so they don't feel like I am either Nickle and Dime'ing them or trying to rip them off. Then I have to be able to communicate to someone (especially when writing invoices) that they understand what I did.  It's hard.  It can be challenging.  Some days are long and tiring but I have to put my best foot forward 
and show the customers that I am approachable, understanding, and fair.  

So back to my first paragraph, if I had to tell my younger self what kind of jobs I need to focus on to be great at my future IT Career, it would be to focus on giving
good customer service.  My first two jobs were a sandwich maker and a computer tutor at a college.  Those helped me out in the long run even though at the time, I just saw them as a stopping point to my goal where I can be shoved into a back room and work on computers all day (spoiler alert, that will never happen).  For those
coming up, I'd say look at that fast food job you have, being able to provide excellent customer service will be a must.  No matter how angry or irate a customer may 
get at you, you still have to be able to communicate with them in a manner that is professional.  Take the time now to learn how to work with your co-workers as well.  IT is a team effort, not a lone gunman type of career.
