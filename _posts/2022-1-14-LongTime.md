It has been a while since I posted.  I've been working on various projects at work that has taken me away from my personal projects and goals.  Fortunately, one thing I have been working on to get me back on track is goal setting.  This has been a skill I have been developing over the last year.  I've been going over material by Gino Wickman, Steven Covey, and others to work on the concepts and ideas to better set goals and manage my time.

So I did sit down a couple weeks ago and plot my course for 2022.  My overall goal (I only have one, less is more) is to strengthen my security certifications.  I have a degree in Information Technology and Security, but over the last 15 years, I have been in the operations space.  Now this experience has strengthened my technical skills, my team building skills, and my business skills.  But now I need to focus back on the security.  If you have looked at my GitHub, I have a lot of notes for the CISSP.  I do have the job experience for it, but as the more I dive into the test, the more I realize I want to understand the items and concepts behind it.  So for Quarter 1, I will be reviewing the first few domains of the CISSP from a basic security standpoint, and start building towards taking that test this year.

On the personal project side, my switch to Linux last year was a success.  I am way more comfortable in Linux than I ever was.  Part of my switch was fulled by the GUI changes in Windows 11.  After working with a customer yesterday who bought a Windows 11 laptop, I was probably right in that choice (Windows 11 is not bad but why is the start menu in the middle?). I have switched all my systems to Linux Mint, and it has been a great operating system.  But I have been looking at rolling releases for a more upgraded kernel and newer software installs.  So for this quarter I will be taking my poor old D630 back to Manjaro.  
What I'm going to do differently is make it my daily driver for a couple months, if all goes well, then my Lenovo will make the switch.  My desktop I will keep on Linux Mint.  

So here is to a new year and new goals.  Lets see how we do at the end of it all.

73's and take care.
