title: CISSP Study
---

So something I've been working on for too long (or not enough) is getting the CISSP.  I have the work experience and many years (14 years as of last month) in the 
IT field.  I've done security assessments, secured data, designed permissions, worked with encryption, organized data, and performed risk analysis for clients.  
I've also done change control though that is a little new to me (I did Github for a reason).  

Since I am enjoying how Markdown works and to get more familiar with it and GitHub, I am retyping all my written notes to just go over them and to learn Markdown.

Hopefully the repository where I am keeping stuff will be of use to someone in the future and at worse-case, a place where I can find stuff if my backpack ends up missing.

Take Care
