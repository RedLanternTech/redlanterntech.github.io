Hey there! Let me tell you about something super important in my line of work: having a solid plan. Having a plan just for minor tasks has helped out and reduced the ammount of time I spent trying to either troubleshoot an issue or resolve an incident. Let me walk you through a few recent situations that really drove this point home:

## Dealing with Incidents

So, a while back, we had this incident pop up. Can't divulge the details due to confidentiality, but luckily, I had a basic plan in place. It wasn't perfect and had not been applied to this type of incident before, but just having something written down gave me direction. Afterwards, during my lesson's learned step, I applied what was learned and made changes to the document.  This will help others (and myself) be better prepared next time.

## Planning Projects

I'm big on planning, whether it's for client or my personal projects. Take my latest desktop upgrade, for example. It's a major overhaul, switching operating systems (From Manjaro to Fedora Atomic) and testing a bunch of apps. I've got it all mapped out in my Obsidian notebookâ€”what programs I need, backup procedures, and a [contingency plan in case things go haywire](https://redlantern.tech/EscapePlan/).

## Client Server Swap

Then there was the time a client needed a server swap. Talk about nerve-wracking! But with careful planning, step-by-step instructions, coordinating with my team, and keeping the client informed, my team was able pulled it off smoothly. Sure, we hit a few bumps, but nothing we couldn't handle.  The client afterwards commented on how well things went.

In a nutshell, having any plan is better than none (even if it is scrawled out on a McDonalds Napkin at 3 in the morning), especially in cybersecurity. It keeps stress levels down, shows you mean business, and boosts your chances of success.

Remember, a little planning goes a long way in this game!
